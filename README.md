# cvsweb-extract
_Extract file trees from CVSweb mirrors_

Politely scrape archive.org's CVSweb mirror of [oss.sgi.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20171010114930/http://oss.sgi.com/cgi-bin/cvsweb.cgi/#dirlist).  Only the latest version of each file is downloaded.

Should be readily reconfigurable for other CVSweb mirrors on archive.org and elsewhere.

**NOTE**: Please use this script sparingly! And donate to [archive.org](https://archive.org/donate?origin=iawww-TopNavDonateButton) if you have the means.

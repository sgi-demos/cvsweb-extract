# cvsweb-extract
_Extract file trees from CVSweb mirrors_

Politely scrape archive.org's CVSweb mirror of oss.sgi.com.  Currently, only the latest version of each file is downloaded.

Should be readily reconfigurable for other CVSweb mirrors on archive.org and elsewhere.

**NOTE**: Please use this script sparingly! And donate to archive.org if you have the means.
